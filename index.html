        <p>
            
            In your introduction, answer the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>Full name: Randy Cramer</li>
                <li>CIS - Web Development</li>
                <li>I have experience in Web Development, and have completed several jobs as a Freelancer in the past.</li>
                <li>By taking this course, I hope to learn new technologies and method of approach in delivering websites.</li>
                <li>Which editors did you try and which did you settle on (for now)?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            When you're done, submit a link to your page on github via
            the elearn dropbox. If you have any problems, don't stress. Talk
            to me before class next week and we'll go through it again.
