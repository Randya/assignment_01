        <strong> Here is a little about me</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Full name: Randy Cramer</li>
          <li>Major: CIS - Web Development</li>
          <li>By taking this course, I hope to learn new technologies and methods of approach in delivering websites.</li>
          <li>Atom is most likely the text editor I will stick with.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="heading"><strong>Experience</strong></div>
        I have several off and on years of experience working with Html and Css. Starting out, I learned by adding Html and Css to a website I created on the Spruz CMS platform. You could
        build a website easily just clicking buttons, but it lacked the look and feel that I wanted no matter what I tried. After stumbiling upon some of the advanced features they offered
        I noticed that I could add Html and alter Css. I started tinkering and became and addict.
        <p>
          My first "paid" work came upon me after a bit of brain storming on how I could capitalize on what I had learned. Javascript became a language of interest, and I found out about Ajax.
          Ajax will let you update parts of the page in real time, and Spruz lacked the feature. I made my site behave how I wanted, and then decided to sell my development work as plugins.
          The idea paid off, but the market was all wrong. It turns out that selling to a Freemium demographic that is small in numbers doesn't work the best. Live and learn. The plugins do
          make enough to pay for the hosting of 5 sites on the platform, so I can't complain too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always continuing to study, I was able to add to my abilities through time and experience. Confidence began to grow as a result, so I decided it was time to try my hand at designing Spruz
          websites for some extra money. After designing 4 sites and scoring some pretty good money, I knew it was time to get serious. Spruz websites were fun and easy money, but the consistency in
          jobs left much to be desired. It was time to extend out even farther.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing full fledged websites from scratch is where I went next with my skills. I began marketting around my small little town, being sure to look businesses up online and see if they had
          a website. When I found that they did not, I paid them a visit. I've built a few company websites for clients living in the town of Waynesville, Ohio where I reside. Advertising through social
          media, I have also gained a few clients both Nationally and Internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Front end languages such as Html, Css, and Javascript are where I have the most experience, but I have also done a few things with Php and Mysql on the backend of things. Because of the nature
          of security involved with a backend language, I haven't been in a rush to take things to the next level just yet. I've deployed some of my work on my own sites with Php, but not for a client
          just yet. Creating a contact form is one of the projects that I've implemented, complete with an implementation of Google's ReCaptcha service. I've also done some basic templating work, making
          my site much easier to update and work with. I work mostly using the PDO database class to ensure security.
